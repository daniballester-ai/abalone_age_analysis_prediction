# 🐚 Abalone Age Analysis & Prediction

Welcome to the **Abalone Age Analysis & Prediction** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the characteristics of abalones and uses a machine learning model to predict abalone age based on input data.

## 📚 About the Project

The **Abalone Age Analysis** project is designed to analyze various attributes of abalone and make predictions using a machine learning model. The dataset used includes features such as length, diameter, weight, and more to determine characteristics like age.

The main goals of this project are:
- 🧠 **Train a machine learning model** for predicting specific characteristics.
- 📊 **Perform data analysis** to understand the relationships between different features.
- 🌟 **Provide a user-friendly interface** for making predictions based on user input.

### 🌏 Did You Know?

In Korea, abalone collection has a deep cultural heritage tied to the **Haenyeo**, or "sea women." These incredible divers, some of whom are in their 60s or older, dive without scuba gear to collect abalone and other marine life from the ocean floor. This traditional practice has been passed down for generations, emphasizing the harmony between humans and the sea. It’s a testament to human resilience and the sustainable ways of harvesting ocean resources. 🧜‍♀️

## 🖥️ User Interface

We have created a simple and intuitive **interface** for users to input data and receive predictions. This makes it easier for users to:
- Input custom data directly.
- Get instant predictions based on the trained model.
- Understand the model's results with visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abalone-analysis.git
   cd abalone-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook abalone_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## 🔍 How to Use

1. **Open the Notebook** in Jupyter and run the cells to train the model.
2. **Access the User Interface** for data input and prediction:
   - Input the required attributes of an abalone.
   - Click **Predict** to see the model's prediction.
3. **Visualize and analyze** the results directly in the notebook.
